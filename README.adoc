== OpenTelemetry

From https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry.io],

[quote]
OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

This *purpose* of this mule extension is to allow Mule Applications participate in OpenTelemetry-based distributed traces.



NOTE: This module supports OpenTelemetry *Traces* only. Metrics and Logs are _not_ supported, yet. See https://github.com/avioconsulting/mule-opentelemetry-module/issues/38[Issue#38].
